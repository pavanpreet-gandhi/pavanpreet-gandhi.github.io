## About Me

I am an M.Sc. student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London (UCL) and a research intern at Century Tech.

I am particularly motivated by reinforcement learning and its application to large language models. My most recent project involves finetuning LLaMA-based LLM agents in text-based multi-step environments.

My core interest lies in the safe and responsible advancement of AI for the benefit of humanity. I am eager to apply my skills to challenging problems with a positive societal impact.

I am currently seeking research or applied opportunities in AI, machine learning, or data science, starting this autumn (2025). Please feel free to reach out if you have any leads or opportunities at [pavanpreet.gandhi@gmail.com](mailto:pavanpreet.gandhi@gmail.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavanpreet-gandhi/).
